** Pay attention in school!
- Everyone can code, but not everyone can program
- Coding will most likely be your livelihood
- Being able to program *distinguishes* you

* $coding \cap programming \ne \phi$

* What's it like maintaining my work?
- ~2 Github issues per month
* What's stopping you?
1. I'm not good enough
2. I don't have the time
3. I've no idea what to make
* What I've learned
** CS-wise, lots!
- Exposure to new and old ideas
- "Been there, done that"
- Community guidance
** You don't always work with the nicest people
- Oh My Fish DMCA takedown
- code superiority doesn't give you the right to diminish others
** Mistakes will be made
- Careful what you say
- Take responsibility
* Where can you start?
- Libraries you use and love
  - Devise
  - React
  - etc. etc.

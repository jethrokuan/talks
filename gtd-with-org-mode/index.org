* Why GTD?
** Your Brain is a Computer
- Already limited RAM
- Much of it is spent keeping track of "open loops"
- Inability give your 100% to the task at hand

** The Solution
- Having an off-mind system you can trust
- Having a workflow to keep you in control

** The GTD Workflow
1. Capture
2. Clarify
3. Organize
4. Reflect
5. Engage

*** Step 1: Capture
Everything in mind goes into the inbox
- Todos
- Projects
- Errands
- Things to handle/finish
- etc. etc.

*** Step 2: Clarify
- Is it actionable?
- Should I delegate this to someone else?
- What should my next action be?

*** Step 3: Organize
Put items where they belong.
- Next Actions file
- Delegations file
- etc. etc.
*** Step 4: Reflect
Review lists as frequently as needed

*** Step 5: Just Do It!

* Why Emacs and org-mode?
- Emacs is great!
- Org-mode is great!
  - Org capture/refile
  - Deadlines/scheduling
  - Agenda
  - Tags
  - Plain text
- [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-gtd-etc.html][Tons]] of tutorials out there for Org with GTD

** Why create my own mode?
- The GTD tutorials presented still requires a lot of manual work.
- The workflow follows a binary decision tree, and can be automated.
- Try out Elisp

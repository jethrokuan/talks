* Why GTD?
** Your Brain is a Computer
- Already limited RAM
- Much of it is spent keeping track of "open loops"
- Inability give your 100% to the task at hand

** The Solution
- Having an off-mind system you can trust
- Having a workflow to keep you in control

** The GTD Workflow
1. Capture
2. Clarify
3. Organize
4. Reflect
5. Engage

*** Step 1: Capture
Everything in mind goes into the inbox
- Todos
- Projects
- Errands
- Things to handle/finish
- etc. etc.

*** Step 2: Clarify
- Is it actionable?
- Should I delegate this to someone else?
- What should my next action be?

*** Step 3: Organize
Put items where they belong.
- Next Actions file
- Delegations file
- etc. etc.
*** Step 4: Reflect
Review lists as frequently as needed

*** Step 5: Just Do It!

* Why Emacs and org-mode?
- Emacs is great!
- Org-mode is great!
  - Org capture/refile
  - Deadlines/scheduling
  - Agenda
  - Tags
  - Plain text
- [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-gtd-etc.html][Tons]] of tutorials for Org with GTD

** Why create my own mode?
- The GTD tutorials presented require a lot of manual work.
- The workflow follows a binary decision tree, and can be automated.
- Because I can.

* Demo
* Emacs Lisp Basics
** It's already there for you
=C-h i= gives you access to:
- Emacs Lisp Reference
- Emacs Lisp Tutorial
** Emacs Lisp is a Lisp
This means there are tons of parentheses.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(+ 2 (+ 1 3))
#+end_src

These are your friends.
** Variables
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(setq variable-name "Variable")
#+end_src
** Functions
Functions are created with =defun=. Evaluate with =C-M-x=.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun hello (name) (insert "Hello " name))
#+END_SRC
** Lisp is list processing
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Let's store a list of names:
(setq list-of-names '("Sarah" "Chloe" "Mathilde"))

;; Get the first element of this list with `car':
(car list-of-names)

;; Get a list of all but the first element with `cdr':
(cdr list-of-names)
#+END_SRC
* GTD-mode specifics
** Creating a minor mode
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(define-minor-mode gtd-mode
  "GTD mode"
  :lighter " gtd"
  :global t)
#+END_SRC
** =defcustom= and =defgroup=
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defgroup gtd nil
    "Provides an Emacs implementation of the GTD workflow."
    :group 'extensions)

  (defcustom gtd-folder "~/.org/gtd"
    "Folder that contains all GTD-related files. Defaults to \"~/.org/gtd\"."
    :group 'gtd)
#+END_SRC
** Step 1: Capture
No need to reinvent the wheel here. Use =org-capture=.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'org-capture-templates '("i" "Inbox" entry (file gtd-inbox-file)
                                        "* %?%i\n"))
#+END_SRC
** Step 2: Clarify
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun gtd-clear-inbox ()                                                          ;; Define a function `gtd-clear-inbox`
    (interactive)                                                                    ;; Make it invokable with M-x
    (save-window-excursion                                                           ;; let's return here after this function ends
      (find-file gtd-inbox-file)                                                     ;;   open my inbox file
      (beginning-of-buffer)                                                          ;;   go to the start of the file
      (catch 'premature-end                                                          ;;   stop when exception is thrown
        (while (equal ?* (char-after 1))                                             ;;   loop while it's a headline
          (let ((title (org-element-property :raw-value (org-element-at-point))))    ;;     create a local var title containing the title
            (if (y-or-n-p (concat "\"" title "\". Is this actionable?"))             ;;     Ask: is it an actionable?
                (gtd-select-options gtd-actionable-options)                          ;;       yes: present actionable options            
              (gtd-select-options gtd-nonactionable-options))))                      ;;        no: present nonactionable options 
        (message "Inbox clear!"))                                                    ;;   print message clear
